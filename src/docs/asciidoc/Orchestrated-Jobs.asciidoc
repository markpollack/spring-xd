== Orchestrated Jobs

Spring XD provides a DSL for creating a batch job as a directed graph of other jobs.  This type of job is referred to as an orchestrated job.  Much like the DSL for creating streams defintions, the DSL for orchestrated jobs uses Unix style conventions such as the ampersand `&` and double pipe `||` symbols.  

=== DSL Components

The DSL for the orchestrated jobs is used when creating a job definition via the `job create` command.  Note that jobs referenced by the DSL must be defined and deployed prior to launching the orchestrated job. For example:
----
xd:> job create batch_simple_def --definition "batch_simple_module" --deploy
xd:> job create batch_basic_def --definition "batch_basic_module" --deploy
xd:> job create testjob --definition "batch_simple_def || batch_basic_def" --deploy
xd:> job launch testjob
----

==== Conditional Execution

Conditional execution is expressed using a double pipe symbol `||`.  This allows  each
job in the sequence to be launched only if the previous job successfully completed.  In the example below:
----
job create testjob --definition "batch_simple_def || batch_basic_def"
----
When the orchestrated job `testjob` is deployed, it will launch the job `batch_simple_def` and if it completes successfully, then the job `batch_batch_def` will be launched.  If the `batch_simple_def` jobs fails, then the job `batch_basic_def` will not launch.

==== Transitions

The DSL supports fine grained control over the transitions taken during the execution of the directed graph.  Transitions are specified by providing an condition for equality based on the exit value of the previous job.  A job transition is represented by the pipe symbol `|`.  Note, this is loosely derived frompattern matching syntax used in F#.  For example:
----
job create testjob --definition "aaa | FAILED=bbb | SUCCESS=ccc || ddd"
----
In the example above aaa would launch and if it had an exit status of `FAILED`, then the bbb
job would launch. If the exit status of aaa was `SUCCESS` then ccc would launch.  All other
statuses returned by aaa would launch ddd. 

Another type of transition that can be specified uses `'\*'` to represent wildcard matching.  This means that any exit status that is not specifically enumerated by a transition for the current job, the job
associated with the '*' will be launched. ie.
----
job create testjob --definition "aaa | FAILED=bbb | SUCCESS=ccc || ddd | BAD=eee | '*' = fff"
----
In the example above, if an exit status of ddd is `BAD` then the eee job will launch but all
other exit statusâ€™s would launch the fff job.

===== Keywords

The DSL for orchestrated jobs provide two keywords for transitions where the target of the
transition is not another job.

* $END - will either terminate the job orchestration or if used in a split, will
terminate the flow within the specific split.
* $FAIL - will set the status for the orchestrated job to fail and terminate the job
orchestration.

For example

----
job create testjob --definition "aaa | SUCCESS=ccc | '*' = $END" || ddd
----

Will launch the ccc job if the exit status of aaa is `SUCCESS` but otherwise will end the entire testjob execution successfully.  

----
job create testjob --definition "aaa | SUCCESS=ccc | '*' = $END" || ddd
----

Will launch the ccc job if the exit status of aaa is `SUCCESS` but otherwise will failed the entire testjob execution.  


==== Split

Splits allow a for multiple jobs within a orchestrated job to be run in parallel.
It is denoted by  using angle brackets `<>` to group jobs and flows that are to be run
in parallel.  These jobs and flows are separated by the ampersand `&` character.
For example:
----
job create testjob --definition "<aaa & bbb & ccc>"
----
The example above will launch jobs aaa, bbb and ccc in parallel.  With the job 
orchestration DSL a user may also execute multiple split groups in succession.  For example:
----
job create testjob --definition "<aaa & bbb & ccc> || <ddd & eee & fff>"
----
In the example above jobs aaa, bbb and ccc will be launched in parallel,
 once they all complete then jobs ddd, eee and fff will be launched in parallel.  
 Once they complete the orchestrated job will end.

===== Parenthesis

Supports the ability to launch conditional jobs within a split, for example:
----
job create testjob --definition "<(aaa || bbb || ccc) & ddd & eee> || fff"
----
In this example the jobs aaa, bbb, and ccc will be launched in succession at the same 
time that jobs ddd and eee are launched in parallel.  Once all of the jobs are complete 
within the angle brackets job fff will be launched.

=== Orchestrated Job Parameters

Orchestrated jobs currently supports the timeout parameter which establishes the amount 
of time in milliseconds a job can execute within the job orchestration before the XD throws an
`UnexpectedJobExecutionException`.  The default is `-1` which  means no timeout.
An example using the timeout is as follows:
----
job create testjob --definition "aaa || bbb --timeout=5000"
----
The timeout parameter affects all the jobs within the job orchestration.  All parameters for aaa and bbb must have been previously specified in their own job definitions.
